### TO DO
Need to revisit the user storage logic (should be able to implement a cross platform id for each user, kind of like an api key that they can connect to whatever app they want)


Work on AI speed improvements for journalting API

Handle image upload on the frontend part

Implement platform recognition so we can do graph dashboards like waka time

Revisit authentication using signInWithCredential()

### Where I stopped

Need to move on to the registration part so users can add a bunch of additional data and whatnots...
